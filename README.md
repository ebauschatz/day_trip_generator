# Day Trip Generator
This application will allow a user to generate a day trip. A destination, means of transportation, restaurant, and
entertainment are randomly selected from pre-populated lists and presented in turn to the user until they find an
option they like. The available options for restaurant and entertainment selection are dependent on the currently selected destination.

The user will then be presented with a summary of the options they have selected and have the opportunity to reselect any option until they confirm the entire trip. Once the trip is confirmed, a confirmation message and trip overview will be displayed.
